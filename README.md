# Hi there 👋, I'm Yordy Cruz Vasquez!

I have a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a focus on Computer Science. Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience with various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and C#. I’ve worked on projects ranging from game development using Unity to developing a compiler for a Java subset called Espresso. I’ve also had the opportunity to work as an IT intern where I troubleshooted computer issues and managed inventory for essential items. My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and take on new challenges, which is why I’m excited about the opportunities in IT.
